## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `Generator` class with `manual_seed`, `get_state`/`set_state`, and a
  module-level default generator (`trnrand.manual_seed`).
- Standard distributions: `uniform`, `normal`, `standard_normal`,
  `exponential`, `bernoulli`, `randint`, `randperm`, `truncated_normal`.
- Quasi-random sequences: `sobol` (scrambled), `halton`, `latin_hypercube`.
- Backend dispatch: `set_backend` (`auto`/`pytorch`/`nki`), `get_backend`,
  `HAS_NKI` flag.
- Philox 4×32-10 NKI kernel in `trnrand/nki/dispatch.py` with a CPU
  reference (`philox4x32_reference`, `philox_uniform_cpu`) used as the
  conformance oracle. CPU-side spec invariants and the three canonical
  Salmon et al. SC'11 test vectors are verified in
  `tests/test_nki_philox.py::TestPhiloxReference`.
- Box-Muller transform on the Vector Engine for `normal()`, with a CPU
  reference (`box_muller_cpu`) and CPU-side distributional tests
  (`TestBoxMullerReference`).
- MC vs QMC hypersphere-volume example in `examples/mc_integration.py`.
- Test suites for distributions (reproducibility, statistics, bounds) and
  quasi-random sequences (uniformity, determinism, stratification).

### Known limitations

- **NKI path is not hardware-validated yet.** The Philox and Box-Muller
  kernels are scaffolded against the NKI 2.24 API and pass the CPU
  conformance oracle by construction, but the `@pytest.mark.neuron`
  suite has not yet run on trn1/trn2. Tracked in #1 (Philox) and #2
  (Box-Muller). Until validated, `trnrand` falls back to `torch.Generator`
  on CPU — the backend dispatch path is the only user-visible difference.
- **Benchmarks vs cuRAND pending hardware access** (#3).
